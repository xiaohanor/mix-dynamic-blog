Hey there, I'm Zihan Li and this is a video presentation of my major assignment. In the first section, I will give you an overview of the scenario, including VPC, EC2, subnets, and security groups. 
Let's get started! As you can see, I've created a VPC named "zihan-vpc" with four subnets - two public and two private. Now, let's take a look at the security group. It's a Windows Security Group that enables Windows access. You can see its inbound rules allow all traffic from every IPv4 address, so I can access my EC2 instance from my computer. 
The final thing I want to show you is the EC2 instance. This instance is a Windows workstation that uses the same security group and VPC as RDS. 
Moving on to the second section, I'll show you how I use remote desktop to connect to the EC2 Windows workstation instance, which will allow me to access the Windows environment of the instance from my local computer. 
And finally, in the last section, I'll demonstrate how to connect to the RDS database using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio within the remote desktop session. 
I hope this presentation is informative and helpful. Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks for watching!
